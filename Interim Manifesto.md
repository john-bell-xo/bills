  * surpassing defense spending expectations set by NATO to guarantee allied intervention in the event of war
  * commissioning two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and complementary squadrons of fifth generation fighters to defend our borders
  * increasing funding for counter-terrorism programs including **Pursue** and **Prevent** to prevent our youth from becoming radicalized and to stop attacks before they occur
* ### Protect our industry by
  * auditing the current government to root out corruption and foreign intervention
  * lowering tariffs of supplies and intermediate goods to make our industries more profitable 
  * subsidizing essential sectors such as the manufacture of computer chips to safeguard our trade secrets 
* ### Encourage small businesses by
  * lowering the corporation tax to increase the attractiveness of opening a business
  * changing labour regulations to reduce initial overhead
  * loosening **"accredited investor"** regulations to let more investors sponsor promising businesses 
* ### Safeguard our democracy by
  * stopping the endless referendums designed to chip away at a unified Britain
  * leaving the EU after the people we represent have decided to do so
  * implementing a **blockchain-based** "secured voter" system to eliminate widespread voter fraud
