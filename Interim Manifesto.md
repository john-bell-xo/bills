# NSP Manifesto

## Fighting for a safer Britain
## We will...
* ### Invest in our safety by
  * surpassing defense spending expectations set by NATO to guarantee allied intervention in the event of war
  * commissioning two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and complementary squadrons of fifth generation fighters to defend our borders
  * increasing funding for counter-terrorism programs including **Pursue** and **Prevent** to prevent our youth from becoming radicalized and to stop attacks before they occur
* ### Protect our industry by
  * auditing the current government to root out corruption and foreign intervention
  * lowering tariffs of supplies and intermediate goods to make our industries more profitable 
  * subsidizing essential sectors such as the manufacture of computer chips to safeguard our trade secrets 
* ### Safeguard our democracy by
  * stopping the endless referendums designed to chip away at a unified Britain
  * leaving the EU after the people we represent have decided to do so
  * implementing a "secured voter" system to eliminate widespread voter fraud
* ### Help our most valuable resource: children by
  * guaranteeing accessible student loans at the current prime interest rate to make sure every child is able to pursue higher education
  * redesigning out-of-date computer courses to a modern standard to make our children able to compete in an increasingly digitized world
  * eliminating the right of teachers' unions to strike to ensure our children's education won't be impacted by short-sighted greed
* ### Keep human rights accessible to all humans by
  * entering peacekeeping missions in war-ravaged places like the Congo
  * intervening against repressive regimes economically and militarily
